# Smart Prediction of Crop Yield & Health

## Project Overview
**Smart Prediction of Crop Yield & Health** is a machine learning-based system designed to predict crop yield and detect crop diseases using advanced AI algorithms. By leveraging data such as environmental factors, soil health, and crop conditions, this system helps farmers and agronomists make informed decisions, optimize crop management, and increase productivity while preventing potential disease outbreaks.

## Features
- **Crop Yield Prediction**: Predict crop yield based on historical data, weather patterns, and soil conditions.
- **Disease Detection**: Identify potential crop diseases using image classification and real-time environmental data.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize trends in crop health, yield predictions, and disease forecasts.
- **AI-Powered Insights**: Utilize machine learning models like Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for accurate predictions.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for data processing, model development, and integration.
- **Scikit-learn**: Used for implementing machine learning models for crop yield prediction.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Used for building deep learning models for disease detection from crop images.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization and performance analysis.
- **OpenCV**: Used for image processing in disease detection.
- **Flask** (Optional): Web framework for deploying the model as an API.

## Prerequisites
Make sure to have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (for running and testing models locally)
- Required Python libraries:
